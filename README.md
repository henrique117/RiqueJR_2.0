# RIQUE JR (Official Release)

> Status: Developing

## Description:

- Hi! Here is a Discord Application made by me with the purpose of studing more about JavaScript and the Discord.js library. I also used Sequelize to create a Local storage to store some informations.


## The project:

- I started this project after a failed attempt of creating a Discord bot, after the Discord.js updated to v14, I decided to give up, but after a long time, I started it again with a lot of new things added and this time a lot better than the previous one.


## Commands and functions:

- Rique Jr. has a lot of functionalities, the major part being only for fun and personal studing, check out the commands:

  + ### 1. For fun commands:
    + <h4>Freedozera: </h4>Just a embed that I made for fun to a friend of mine, studing about Discord embeds.
    + <h4>Pika: </h4>One of the first commands I made, it's simple and pretty fun as well.
    + <h4>Ping: </h4>Pong!!
    
  + ### 2. Study stuff:
    + <h4>CriptRSA: </h4>I made this one for a school homework that I find cool to do with some code.
    + <h4>DecriptRSA: </h4>I also did the reverse.
  

  ## Sequelize and coins:

  - After doing all those commands i was thinking about something harder than that and I had a great idea of a currency system to my bot and make the fun even funnier! Sign in on the bot using the <code>**/register**</code> command you can have access to that beautiful stuff:

   + ### 1. Basic currency commands:
     + <h4>Wallet: </h4>Check how many coins you have in you account.
     + <h4>Pix: </h4>Transfer any amount of coins the another user.
     + <h4>Show: </h4>Show all the bot users in a list.
     
   + ### 2. Earning coins:
     + <h4>Daily: </h4>Typing <code>$daily</code> in any chat you can redeem 200 coins every 12 hours, at 9am and 9pm the daily resets and you can claim it again

   + ### 3. Admin and control commands (Just me can use it):
     + <h4>Add: </h4>Add an amount of coins to an user.
     + <h4>Remove: </h4>Remove an amount of coins of an user.
     + <h4>Delete: </h4>Delete any register of the DataBase.
     + <h4>Reset: </h4>Reset the <code>$daily</code> for everyone.
     + <h4>Bonus: </h4>Give an amount of coins to everyone registered at the bot.


  ## The Games:

  - That's the most exciting part of this project, I've coded 2 simple games to play and spend your coins in bets, for you try to multiply your coins and be the top 1 in the list:

   + ### "The Tigrinho":
     - This one works pretty simple, you have a chance of multiply your coins betted in the game, not a big deal, just by typing <code>**$tigrinho {value}**</code> you can bet any amount to try to multiply it:
