# RIQUE JR (Official Release)

> Status: Developing

## Description:

- Hi! Here is a Discord Application made by me with the purpose of studing more about JavaScript and the Discord.js library. I also used Sequelize to create a Local storage to store some informations.


## The project:

- I started this project after a failed attempt of creating a Discord bot, after the Discord.js updated to v14, I decided to give up, but after a long time, I started it again with a lot of new things added and this time a lot better than the previous one.


## Commands and functions:

- Rique Jr. has a lot of functionalities, the major part being only for fun and personal studing, check out the commands:

  + ### 1. For fun commands:
    + <h4>Freedozera: </h4>Just a embed that I made for fun to a friend of mine, studing about Discord embeds.
    + <h4>Pika: </h4>One of the first commands I made, it's simple and pretty fun as well.
    + <h4>Ping: </h4>Pong!!
    
  + ### 2. Study stuff:
    + <h4>CriptRSA: </h4>I made this one for a school homework that I find cool to do with some code.
    + <h4>DecriptRSA: </h4>I also did the reverse.
  

  ## Sequelize and coins:

  - After doing all those commands i was thinking about something harder than that and I had a great idea of a currency system to my bot and make the fun even funnier! Sign in on the bot using the <code>**/register**</code> command you can have access to that beautiful stuff:

   + ### 1. Basic currency commands:
     + <h4>Wallet: </h4>Check how many coins you have in you account.
     + <h4>Pix: </h4>Transfer any amount of coins the another user.
     + <h4>Show: </h4>Show all the bot users in a list.
     
   + ### 2. Earning coins:
     + <h4>Daily: </h4>Typing <code>$daily</code> in any chat you can redeem 200 coins every 12 hours, at 9am and 9pm the daily resets and you can claim it again

   + ### 3. Admin and control commands (Just me can use it):
     + <h4>Add: </h4>Add an amount of coins to an user.
     + <h4>Remove: </h4>Remove an amount of coins of an user.
     + <h4>Delete: </h4>Delete any register of the DataBase.
     + <h4>Reset: </h4>Reset the <code>$daily</code> for everyone.
     + <h4>Bonus: </h4>Give an amount of coins to everyone registered at the bot.


  ## The Games:

  - That's the most exciting part of this project, I've coded 2 simple games to play and spend your coins in bets, for you try to multiply your coins and be the top 1 in the list:

   + ### 1. "The Tigrinho":
     
     - This one works pretty simple, you have a chance of multiply your coins betted in the game, not a big deal, just by typing <code>**$tigrinho {value}**</code> you can bet any amount to try to multiply it:

     - The chances of multiply or lose your coins is updated in the command <code>/tabela</code>, which is an embed showing the chances of winning any multiplier.
    
   + ### 2. Russian Roulette:
     
     - The most complex part of my project yet, by using the command <code>/rr {value}</code> a Russian Roulette game will start, it consists in a 6 bullets gun with one of them being a real one and the other 5 are fake bullets, you can shoot or not, you choose it by clicking in the buttons <code>Continuar</code> to shoot or the <code>Cancelar</code> button to stop playing the game and get what you have in the game:

     - More you shoot, more you win, the multiplier will aply in how many shots you did until you stop or win the game, but you have to remember that you have a chance to shoot a real bullet and lose the game.

  ## Code:

  - All the code is Open Source since i used to study and this is for personal improvment. I am a Computer Science student getting my degree LOL, so yeah, if anyone have any comments about the code and how I can improve it, feel free to DM me in my social medias:
